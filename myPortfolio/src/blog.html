                <h3>Describe one thing you learned in class today.</h3>
                <p>I worked with repositories in the past, but never learned them to this detail.</p>
                <h3>Describe your workflow when you create a web page.</h3>
                <p><ol class="Roman">
                    <li>Decide what the page is going to be about.</li>
                    <li>Design the page on paper on in paint (WireFrame).</li>
                    <li>Based on the design, determine what selectors I will need.</li>
                    <li>Write the code.</li>
                    <li>Test and fix bugs or errors.</li>
                    <li>Finalize website.</li>
                </ol></p>
                <h3>Explain what ARIA and screen readers are, and how to make a website accessible.</h3>
                <p>ARIA and screen readers are used to help make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
                <p>Semantic and page design help to make pages easier to navigate.  Using semantic HTML elements and grouping</p>
                <p>your page in a way that makes sense will help to greatly improve your pages accessibility.</p>
                <h3>What excites or interests you about coding?</h3>
                <p>Creating something new, that's useful and I'm extremely interested in AI.</p>
                <h3>What does a doctype do?</h3>
                <p>Specifies the rules for the HTML so that the browser displays the code correctly.</p>
                <h3>Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.</h3>
                <p>Specificity</p>

                <h3>Describe one thing you learned in class today.</h3>
                <p>jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites</p>
                <h3>Describe the difference between script, script async and script defer.</h3>
                <p>Script without defer or async will execute immediately before the page loads.<br>
                Async will execute while the page is loading.  Defer will wait until the page<br>
                loads before executing script.</p>
                <h3>What are data- attributes good for?</h3>
                <p>Creating custom code that can be further manipulated using java script.</p>
                <h3>Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.</h3>
                <p>Cookies take specified user data and store it on the web server.  Session and local<br>
                storage have more storage and save the info to the users browser on their local machine.<br>
                Local stores the info indefinitely while session stores the data until the user leaves the page.</p>
                <h3>What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?</h3>
                <p>text</p>
